# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    I had a lot of trouble trying to think in Python when my brain has been kind of wired to java, so trying to adjust has been difficult. In particular I had trouble trying to understand how you can have one soltuion that can solve any case, as my instinct is to have a seperate solution for each case. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    You could use the function to grab dates or movie titles from an given database, using the match function to identifiy keywords and select desired information.
